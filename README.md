# Auto-organizer

To use, specify the file extension to look for and the directory to send those files in config.json.

You can nest file directories and specify your file extensions like this:

```
    "a.b.c.txt": "/dir/c/b/a/"
  
    or
    
    ".icon.png": "/pictures/icon/",
    ".png": "/pictures/"
```

This will send that specific extension to that directory.
